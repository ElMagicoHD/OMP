This problem has many real world applications, such as minimizing the total travel cost for a group of people who want to ﬁnd a location for gathering. While this problem has been well studied in the Euclidean space, the recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithm for solving this problem in the context of road networks is still not efﬁcient. In this paper, we propose a new baseline algorithm for the OMP query, which reduces the search space from |Q| · |E| to |V | + |Q|. We also present two effective pruning techniques that further accelerate the baseline algorithm. Finally, in order to support spatial applications that involve large ﬂow of queries and require fast response, an extremely efﬁcient algorithm is proposed to ﬁnd a high-quality near-optimal meeting point, which is orders of magnitude faster than the exact OMP algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the efﬁciency of our algorithms.}, number = {11}, journal = {Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment}, author = {Yan, Da and Zhao, Zhou and Ng, Wilfred}, year = {2011}, pages = {968–979} }

    abstract = {Finding the shortest path in road networks becomes one of important issues in location based services (LBS). The problem of finding the optimal meeting point for a group of users has also been well studied in existing works. In this paper, we investigate a new problem for two users. Each user has his/her own source and destination. However, whether to meet before going to their destinations is with some uncertainty. We model it as minimum path pair (MPP) query, which consists of two pairs of source and destination and a user-specified weight α to balance the two different needs. The result is a pair of paths connecting the two sources and destinations respectively, with minimal overall cost of the two paths and the shortest route between them. To solve MPP queries, we devise algorithms by enumerating node pairs. We adopt a location-based pruning strategy to reduce the number of node pairs for enumeration. An efficient algorithm based on point-to-point shortest path calculation is proposed to further improve query efficiency. We also give two fast approximate algorithms with approximation bounds. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.},

For example, a travel agency may issue OMP query to decide the location for a tourist bus to pick up the tourists thus minimizing the total travel cost for tourist. The OMP problem has been well studied in the Euclidean space. The currently available algorithms for solving this problem in the context of road networks are still not efficient for the practical applications and are in-memory algorithms which do not guarantee the scalability for the large road databases. Further, the most of the research work has been carried out around the single point OMP; however, the k-OMP problem on the road network setting is still unexplored. In this paper, we are proposing multiple variants of the scalable external-memory based algorithms for computing the optimal meeting point. There are mainly three variants of the proposed grid based algorithms i.e. Basic Grid based, Hierarchical Grid based and Greedy Centroid based OMP search. Later we used single point OMP as a start point to explore the k points OMP using breadth first search. The I/O optimized spatial grids are loaded from the secondary storage as and when required and hence the I/O complexity is reduced to O(N/B) as opposed to O(N) in the existing methods; where B is the average number of road vertices of the grid block. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets.}, booktitle = {Databases in Networked Information Systems}, publisher = {Springer}, author = {Tiwari, Shivendra and Kaushik, Saroj}, editor = {Madaan, Aastha and Kikuchi, Shinji and Bhalla, Subhash}, year = {2013}, pages = {277–292}, collection = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science} }

@inproceedings{Lanthier_Nussbaum_Wang_2005, place = {Newcastle, Australia}, series = {CRPIT}, title = {Calculating the Meeting Point of Scattered Robots on Weighted Terrain Surfaces}, abstractNote = {In this paper we discuss the problem of determining a meeting point of a set of scattered robots R = {r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r s } in a weighted terrain P which has n > s triangular faces. Our algorithmic approach is to produce a discretization of P by producing a graph G = {V      } which lies on the surface of P . For a chosen vertex p , we define ##(r i , p )# as the minimum weight cost of traveling from r i to p . We show that min p G {max 1#i#s {##(r i , p )#}} # min p #P {max 1#i#s {##(r i , p )#}} +W |L| where L is the longest edge of P , W is the maximum cost weight of a face of P , and p is the optimal solution. This error of W |L| is an upper bound which can be stated more precisely as , where m is an adjustable non-zero parameter and k is the maximum number of segments of #(r i , p ) # 1 # i # s. Our algorithm requires O(snm log(snm)+ snm ) time to run, in the weighted metric. However, we show through experimentation that only a constant value of m is required (e.g., m=8) in order to produce very accurate solutions ( 1\% error). Hence, for typical terrain show that by using geometrical subsets (i.e., 2D/3D convex hulls, 2D/3D bounding boxes and random selection) of the robots we can improve the running time for finding p , with minimal or no additional accuracy error when comparing p .}, booktitle = {Eleventh Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium (CATS2005)}, publisher = {ACS}, author = {Lanthier, Mark A. and Nussbaum, Doron and Wang, Tsuo-jung}, editor = {Atkinson, Mike and Dehne, Frank}, year = {2005}, pages = {107–118}, collection = {CRPIT} }
